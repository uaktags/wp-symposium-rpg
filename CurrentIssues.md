WP-Symposium-RPG
================

No new development would be complete without some list of things not working.

Current as of: 05/02/2013 6:33PM EST

Currently we have the following to fix:
[ ] $bonus = get_option().... seems to return "1" for 'new_thread" but nothing for other arguments
[ ] $bonus = get_option().... returning "1" is also a problem as "1" may not be the value it's set to return
[ ] Install feature isn't created to add 'hp' to 'symposium_usermeta' db
[ ] Plugin requires hardwiring into WPS scripts...are there hooks in place already we could use?
[ ] WPS is already compatiable with CubePoints....could we integrate with it?
