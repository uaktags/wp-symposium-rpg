wp-symposium-rpg
================

WP-Symposium-RPG hooks into WP-Symposium to add RPG elements to WPS' functionality.

As of version 0.1, only a bonus system has been created.

----------------------------

Updated with a demo:
http://wpsrpg.uaktech.net/wordpress/

some accounts:
testadmin : testadmin
test : test
test2 : test2
test3 : test3

Everyone starts with 100HP, 0XP, 5Str, 5Def, level 1

I haven't coded the wp_cron yet to replenish HP over time nor have i built a hospital function yet, so HP is kinda permanent.
I also haven't created the 0HP = Dead function due to the statement above
I ALSO ALSO haven't created:
-Leveling up
-Items to increase Str/Def
-Functions/actions to increase Str/Def

I have created the bonus system I wanted for actions like making new threads and stuff....just doesn't seem to be working :-P
